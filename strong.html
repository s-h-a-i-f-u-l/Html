<p>Allah created the order of the universe in superb detail to allow man to grasp His greatness. A verse referring to
    this order reads,”...so that you might know that Allah has power over all things and that Allah encompasses all
    things in His knowledge.” <strong>(Qur’an, 65:12)</strong> Faced with the sublimity of the details of this order, man becomes in awe,
    recognizing that Allah’s wisdom, knowledge and might is infinite.</p>
